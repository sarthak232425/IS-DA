This folder should contain your images.

Recommended filenames used by the HTML:
- profile.jpg  (profile photo)
- sample1.jpg  (gallery image 1)
- sample2.jpg  (gallery image 2)
- sample3.jpg  (gallery image 3)

Replace these placeholder names with your own images (JPEG/PNG). If you don't have images yet, leave placeholders and the page will still render (broken image icons may appear).
