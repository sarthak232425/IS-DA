# Personal Portfolio — Week 1 (HTML)

Project: simple personal portfolio demonstrating basic HTML structure, semantic tags, images, internal navigation and a contact form.

Files created
- [index.html](index.html) — main portfolio page
- [style.css](style.css) — basic styles
- images/ — folder for profile and gallery images (includes placeholder)
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) — optional (empty)

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with → browser).
2. Replace images in the `images/` folder (profile.jpg, sample1.jpg, sample2.jpg, sample3.jpg) with your own photos/screenshots.

What I learned
- HTML5 document structure and semantic tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
- Creating forms with proper labels, input types and required attributes.
- Adding images with meaningful `alt` text and building internal navigation links.

Validation
- Use the W3C validator (https://validator.w3.org/) to validate `index.html`.

Next steps
- Add real images to the `images/` folder.
- Enhance styling and make the site fully responsive.
- Optionally wire the contact form to a backend or use a service such as Formspree for submissions.
